  <h1>What Is AI, Really?</h1>
  <p>Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is a field of computer science that aims to create machines that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. These tasks include recognizing speech, making decisions, understanding natural language, and even driving cars.</p>
  <p>At its core, AI involves teaching computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed for every single task.</p>
  <p>For example, when you use voice assistants like Siri or Alexa, they rely on AI to understand your commands and respond appropriately.</p>
  <p>AI is already part of everyday life, and as it continues to grow, it will change how we live, work, and interact with technology.</p>
